This program takes IR beam based Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) data from multiple text files (generated by Med-Associates software) and organizes it into an Excel sheet that can then be easily analyzed. Specifically, the program takes 25 numerical and text values from text files, labels and organizes into columns, then exports that data into an Excel sheet. Each row of the sheet represents a different text file, and each column represents a different measure of behavior or independent variable. 

To use the program you simply click "Compile" where the program will ask you to locate the location of your EPM text files. Once that's completed you can then click the "Export" button where you can choose the name and location where the new Excel sheet will be saved.
